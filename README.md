# Introductory-Projects-Data-Science
Set of small projects I did myself getting some inspiration out of nowhere.

# Background Information
This repository contains some small projects on data I got from various sources on internet on which I tried to implement my Data Science knowledge to get some useful predictions. The models might not be accurate and my way of implementing the models could be wrong therefore feel free to edit it or comment suggestions. All the projects in this repository contains some Models so sikit-learn is must for the model.

## Libraries used
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

# For new learners
If you have started learning Data Science and wants to get some hands on small projects after getting some knowledge about data scientist workflow and libraries then these projects could be a good practice for you. I have tried my best to add comments wherever possible to make the process easy for you to understand. I have further added readme files inside each project to get you idea about what I have done in the project.
